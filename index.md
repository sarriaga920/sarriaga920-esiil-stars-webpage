As a lecturer at MSU Denver, I teach courses in geography, GIS, climate change, indigenous geographies, urban geography, and transportation planning. My research interests include transportation planning and geography through the lens of sustainability. I recently began working on two interesting research projects with my students and colleagues. The first is a study on the transportation experiences of people in the blind and low vision community,specifically looking at their use of rideshare technologies. Second, I am working on a study analyzing where to locate new electric vehicle charging stations in Colorado by utilizing machine learning and programming to model electric vehicle failre rates. My favorite part of my job is working with students on research projects that they are passionate about and seeing them succeed in their educational and career goals.
